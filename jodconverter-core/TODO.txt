To completely include sigar we need to get the entire zip.
Then we need to add an antrun execution that will unzip the files to some directory in this project
where we want them. We only need the sigar-bin/lib folder (minus log4j.jar)
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin/usage.html

Until then, we manually put the required native files in the depends folder, 
and then we can add them in the java.library.path
