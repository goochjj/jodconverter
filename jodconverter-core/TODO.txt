To run the tests and install/package jodconverter you need to include the 
depends/sigar-bin/lib/ in the java.library.path which is located in the target folder when you build 
using maven.

Alternatively you can add the directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH path variabel.
(Assuming you are standing in the project-base folder).

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/depends/hyperic-sigar-1.6.5/sigar-bin/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
